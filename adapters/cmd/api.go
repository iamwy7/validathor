	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// apiCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	apiCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&port, "port", "p", ":9000", "Custom port to be used on api")
